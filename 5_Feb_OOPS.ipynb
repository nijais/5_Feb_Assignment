    "# Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class and object are two important concepts in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that the objects          created from the class will have. For example, a class named Person might have attributes such as name, age, and address and behaviors      such as speaking and walking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An object is an instance of a class. In other words, it is a specific representation of the class. For example, if you have a class          named Person, you can create individual objects representing specific people, such as John, Jane, and Joe. Each of these objects would      have their own unique values for the attributes defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here's an example to demonstrate the concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age, address):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "        self.address = address\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def walk(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"I am walking to my address at {self.address}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"John\", 32, \"123 Main St.\")\n",
    "person2 = Person(\"Jane\", 28, \"456 Market St.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "person1.speak()\n",
    "person1.walk()\n",
    "\n",
    "person2.speak()\n",
    "person2.walk()\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The above code creates a class Person with three attributes: name, age, and address, and two methods: speak and walk. Then, two objects      person1 and person2 are created from the Person class and assigned their own unique values for the attributes. Finally, the speak and        walk methods are called on each of the objects to demonstrate that each object has its own unique representation of the class."

    "# Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data and code acting on the data within a single unit or object. It           means that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside world and can only be accessed through a well-defined         interface. Encapsulation provides a level of security and protection to the data within an object. It also enables the                       implementation details of an object to change without affecting the objects that use it.\n",
    "#### 2. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. It allows the         creation of a new class based on an existing class. The new class is called a subclass, and the existing class is called a                   superclass. The subclass automatically inherits all the members (fields, methods, etc.) of the superclass and can add new members or         override the members of the superclass. Inheritance provides a way to reuse the code and define new objects based on existing               objects.\n",
    "#### 3. Abstraction: Abstraction is a mechanism that allows hiding the implementation details of a class and showing only the necessary             information to the outside world. It is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class           that cannot be instantiated but can be inherited by concrete subclasses. An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods           that must be implemented by classes that implement the interface. Abstraction helps to reduce the complexity of a system by hiding           the implementation details of an object and providing a clear and concise interface.\n",
    "#### 4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows objects of different classes related by             inheritance to be treated as objects of the same class. Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as objects of the most general           type in a hierarchy. For example, if a subclass object is referred to as an object of its superclass, the object will still be able         to access all its specific methods. This means that the same method can be applied to objects of different classes and can behave           differently based on the type of object. Polymorphism enables the creation of generic algorithms that can work with objects of               different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### These four pillars of OOP form the basis of object-oriented design and provide a way to create complex, scalable, and maintainable          software systems."

    "# Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. It is        also known as the constructor. The purpose of the __init__ method is to initialize the attributes of the object when it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example, consider a class Person that represents a person with a name and age. The __init__ method could be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When an object of the class Person is created, the __init__ method is called automatically and sets the values of the name and age          attributes for that object. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "p = Person(\"John\", 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This creates an object p of the class Person and sets its name attribute to \"John\" and its age attribute to 30. The __init__ method is      a convenient way to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created, without having to write additional code to set the            values of those attributes."

    "# Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), self is a reference to the instance of the class that is being executed. It is a special variable      in Python classes that refers to the instance of the object that is calling the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The self parameter is used to access the attributes and methods of the current instance of a class. When a method is called on an           object, the object is passed as the first argument to the method, and this argument is usually referred to as self.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The use of self enables the method to access and modify the attributes of the object that is calling the method. It makes it possible        for methods to manipulate the state of the object, and for objects to interact with each other."

    "#### There are several types of inheritance in OOP, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Single Inheritance: Single inheritance is the simplest form of inheritance where a subclass inherits from a single superclass. In           this type of inheritance, a subclass inherits all the properties and behavior of its superclass. For example, consider a class               Animal that represents an animal with a name and a method to make a sound. A subclass Dog can be defined as follows:\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",

    "### 2. Multi-Level Inheritance: Multi-level inheritance is a form of inheritance where a subclass inherits from a subclass. In this type of         inheritance, a subclass inherits all the properties and behavior of its superclass and its superclass's superclass, and so on. For           example, consider a class Mammal that represents a mammal with a method to make a sound. A subclass Animal can be defined as                 follows:\n",

    "### 3. Multiple Inheritance: Multiple inheritance is a form of inheritance where a subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. In this           type of inheritance, a subclass inherits all the properties and behavior of multiple superclasses. For example, consider a class             FlyingAnimal that represents an animal that can fly with a method to fly. A subclass Bat can be defined as follows:\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
